Configuring a PyTorch Paperspace Gradient Notebook Instance

- (Re)Install AWS CLI ::

  `unzip awscliv2.zip`
  `./aws/install`

- Run `aws configure`

- Install additional packages ::

  pip install torchdata fsspec s3fs rasterio


For cURL error 77 problem with SSL CA Certificates ::

  run `update-ca-certificates` from the command line

For cURL error 28 request timed out to S3 bucket ::

Seems like all the cURL errors were due to using functions specific to S3. Using FSSpec functions worked and had no issues.
